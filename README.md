# Xops Main Page - React + Vite

This project is a React-based frontend application developed using Vite. It provides a modern and efficient setup for building scalable, high-performance web applications with features like Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and customizable ESLint rules.

## Overview

This repository serves as the main page for the Xops platform. The project utilizes the Vite build tool for an optimized development experience and faster builds. The current setup supports both Babel and SWC for Fast Refresh.

### Key Technologies Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool for modern web projects.
- **ESLint**: Ensures code quality and consistency.

## Features

- Minimal setup for React with Vite.
- Supports Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for a smooth development experience.
- Integration with ESLint for linting.
- Choice of two official plugins:
  - [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) using Babel.
  - [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) using SWC.
